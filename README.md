**Abstract from preprint**: A thorough understanding of depression susceptibility requires research to comprehensively assimilate a vast and complex array of risk factors. We leverage data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health to integrate factors spanning genetic, psychological, social, built, and natural systems and their contribution to depression symptoms from adolescence to adulthood using linear mixed models (N=5,030). First, a subset of 81 prominent individual-level factors explained 83-86% of the variance in adolescence and 14% in adulthood symptoms. Feeling accepted and loved were the most influential in adolescence, and factors contributed relatively equally in adulthood. Second, all 162 factors capturing interconnected systems explained 82-86% of the variance in adolescence and 32% in adulthood. Psychological systems were integral, and we show a complex interplay between genetic vulnerability and psychological processes. We provide a holistic understanding of depression risk and emphasise feeling supported and accepted as crucial for early detection.
